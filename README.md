Geek Social Network


I've created this website as part of my training at Openclassrooms to become a developer. 

This website enables people (mostly geeks) to meet other people who have the same interests (like photography, video-games, ...).
It combines a search engine, an instant messaging box, and profile for each one who registered.
It is exclusively dedicated to people living in France. 

My ambition is to completely redesign this website with Symfony (and maybe ReactJS). I will then promote it through different platform
like Facebook or Instagram.
